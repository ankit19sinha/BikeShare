# Capital Bikeshare Rider Classification

Capital Bikeshare provides bikes for rent via a controlled network of automated kiosk across the city. Using these Bike Sharing systems, people rent a bike from one location and return it to a different or same place on need basis. People can rent a bike through membership (mostly regular users) or on demand basis (mostly casual users). The organization publishes the data on rentals every quarter. The objective here is to understand the behaviour of the users, and eventually classify them as members or casual users.

This project uses the data published by Captial Bikeshare in the year 2017 and has 7 variables (excluding the target variable), and close to 4 million observations.
